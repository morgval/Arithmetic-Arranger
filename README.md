# Arithmetic-Arranger
Project one in the Scientific Computing with Python certification offered by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter).  
Takes a set of addition or subtraction problems and formats them vertically.  If the second argument is set to True, it will also solve them.
