# Arithmetic-Arranger
Project one in the Scientific Computing with Python certification offered by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter).  
Takes a set of addition or subtraction problems and formats them vertically.  If the second argument is set to True, it will also solve them.

This program should:
[x] raise an exception if any of the numbers are longer than 4 digits
[x] raise an exception if any operation other than + or - appears
[x] raise an exception if more than 5 problems are entered
[x] raise an exception if any alpha characters are present
[ ] print the problems list in vertical format
[ ] print the problems answers if a second argument (that is set to True) is included
